# ETF-project

I develop signals based on certain ETFs, namely GLD, GDX, and SLV to see if I can determine any patterns for outperformance. These ETFs are considered based on many considerations. We look to see if the occurrence of returns within a particular band of the distsribution can be telling of future outperformance. We also look to see if distributional properties of the returns are also indicative. These properties include: correlation, volatility, skewness, and kurtosis. The intent is to expand this project beyond just 3 ETFs.
